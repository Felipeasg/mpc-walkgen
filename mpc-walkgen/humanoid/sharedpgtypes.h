/* MPC Walkgen uses three different sampling periods, three different frames and it also considers
  different phases while the robot is walking. In order to avoid confusing situation, please read
  the three items below.


// Sampling times //
 There are three different sampling periods in MPC-Walkgen:

 --The QP sampling period (QPSamplingPeriod). It cannot be chosen freely
   (see "Phases during walking")
 --The MPC sampling period (MPCSamplingPeriod), which corresponds to the time
   between each call of the MPC.
 --The actuation sampling period (actuationSamplingPeriod), which is the period between each instant
   we send samples to the actuators. It allows to generate several interpolated samples for each
   call of the MPC.

 And we have: QPSamplingPeriod >= MPCSamplingPeriod >= actuationSamplingPeriod
 Also, we have QPSamplingPeriod = n * MPCSamplingPeriod = n * m *actuationSamplingPeriod,
 where n and m are integers



//Phases during walking//

 While walking, the robot goes through a movement phase where one of its feet is on the ground
 while the other one is moving. We will call this phase "Simple Support", or "SS".

 Between two steps, both feet are on the ground. We will call this phase
 "Transitional Double Support". However, no QP sample can fall within a Transitional DS.
 Hence QPSamplingPeriod must be equal to the Transitional DS phase duration. This also means that
 during walking, the robot stays continuously in a SS phase until it stops. Note that during a
 DS phase, the support foot is the left one

 On the very beginning and the very end of the walking process, both feet are also on the ground.
 But this time, some QP samples falls within this phase. We will call it "Double Support", or "DS".
 Also, we may use in comments the terms "first" or "final" to refer to the DS support phase on the
 beginning of the walking process or the DS support phase on the end of the walking process
 respectively.



//Frames//

 --The world frame is a fixed Galilean frame attached to the ground.
 --The local frame relative to the current step. It is a fixed Galilean frame which origin and
   orientation are the position and the orientation of the current support foot. We will call this
   frame "Current local frame"
 --The local frame relative to each planned step. It is a piecewise (along time) fixed Galilean
   frame. Its origin and orientation are the position and the orientation of the current support
   foot for a given time. If you are working with future information, e.g. the CoP position during
   the second planned step, then this frame will be attached to the second support foot. We will
   call this frame "Time-dependent local frame"

   Note that the position of each foot is defined as the origin of the frame in which
   CoP hull vertices coordinates are given.
